              Inanimate objects are becoming smart. Electrical devices we bring into our homes, from thermostats and light switches to fridges and heating systems can now be connected to the internet. Our Bridge will find all of these devices, connect them securely and show you a rich variety of apps that provide you with useful and exciting services. We also look after your privacy: nobody can see or control your connected devices without your permission.

              With ContinuumBridge, providing services that make use of connected devices is just a matter of writing an app. Our apps live primarily on the home bridge rather than on a smart phone and can make use of any connected devices in the home. Potential services include energy management, security, e-health, assisted living and home automation, but with low barriers to creating new Internet-of-Things applications

              The ContinuumBridge home bridge searches for new devices and asks users if they want them to become part of their network. Currently devices can be connected using Bluetooth Smart and WiFi and we will add other protocols according to demand. New devices are easily supported by creating a simple adapter. This opens your products up to a world of innovative apps that can use them and access to new and diverse markets through our app market.

              ContinuumBridge apps run on the home bridge, with user interaction via integrated web-apps and phone-apps. ContinuumBridge provides server infrastructure for the back-end and developers may also integrate with their own back-ends. The bridge takes care of connecting to devices and all communication with them is performed using a unified JSON API. ContinuumBridge is currently working with a limited number of alpha developers. Please register if you would like to be kept informed of wider releases.
